A database (ANSI SQL) for a movies booking app


*	This app shows all movies available across all theaters at a location (could be a city or town)
*	When a User/Customer opens this app, they would be presented with currently running Movies
*	Based on the Customer’s selection, the app would then show the current Showtimes per the user’s selected location radius.
*	Once the user selects for Showtime and Theater, the app would then prompt to choose a Seat and ultimately make a Booking.
*	For the sake of simplicity, all Theaters have a single screen and a seating capacity of 50
